# Miscellaneous small programs

This is a random collection of programs and other short bits of code that
don't warrant their own repo.  Each program should have a short description
below.  In general, these programs won't follow modern organizational
patterns, as they're scripts and one-offs.

## ff_schedule12.py
This program generates a fantasy football schedule for a 12 team, 2 division
league where every team plays the other teams in the division twice (once
each as home and as away), and a random selection of three teams from the
other division.
